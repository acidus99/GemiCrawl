# Kennedy
Kennedy is a search engine for [Gemini space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)). It consists of a crawler, backend, and Gemini app server. Kennedy leverages many of the techniques and architecture from early WWW crawlers and search engines like Mercator, Archive.org, and GoogleBot.

## Why?
>Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said, "Because it is there."
