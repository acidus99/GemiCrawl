- Charsets
    - Not using them when parsing/indexing content
    - Incorrectly outputing all content as UTF-8 in archive view

- Archive view
    - Setting a top header on all text content, but header has Gemtext markup
        - Prehaps wrap text in preformatted gates?
    - Not rewriting hyperlinks in Archive View
    - Better handling of non-text content
        - always show a text landing page
        - Include text about when it was captured
        - have link to the file
        - have link to other verions



- Delorean

	- Show number of captures in match view?
	- Increase number of match views
	- Maybe should a filetype icon?
		probably makes sense to do this for the PAge Info page aas well.


Diff/stuff in archive is odd:
