=== WARC work:
    - Need to grab (latest?) robots.txt (from archive? from the scan datbase) and prune items when importing WARC (especially when loading in older WARCs)
    - "gemini://kennedy.gemi.dev/page-info?id=-*" are in archive, but shouldn't since robots excludes it
    - "kennedy" search results are indexed as a result in Kennedy ?!?!? (Search for cats)

    - oh snap, when importing multiple WARCs into the search index, if a later search index has an error like a timeout, we aren't clearing the FTS entries for it
    - crash importing WARC: /Users/billy/HDD Inside/Kennedy-Work/WARCs/2023-04-20.warc	42700	316 ms

=== Truncated body should still have some content


- Charsets
    - Not using them when parsing/indexing content
    - Incorrectly outputing all content as UTF-8 in archive view

- Archive view
    - Setting a top header on all text content, but header has Gemtext markup
        - Prehaps wrap text in preformatted gates?
    - Not rewriting hyperlinks in Archive View
    - Better handling of non-text content
        - always show a text landing page
        - Include text about when it was captured
        - have link to the file
        - have link to other verions



- Delorean

	- Show number of captures in match view?
	- Increase number of match views
	- Maybe should a filetype icon?
		probably makes sense to do this for the PAge Info page aas well.



    - If a response is not a 20, (like a redirect) show that in the Url history view. Right now it just looks like empty repsonses (size 0 B)

Diff/stuff in archive is odd:

- Support 44 slow down




// WARC refactor:
- Need to make sure detected language is normalized to ISO lang codes
- When converting older crawls to WARC, not properly seeing truncated header in output WARCs
- 44 slow downs probably shouldn't be imported into the search DB or archive

- WarcProtocol parser is pretty slow. 2x slower than warcio on my laptop, and about 100x slower than a raw read baseline

- File extension needs to be added to Documents data to better support future "ext:" search operator
- File type detection needs to be added to support future "type:png" search operator

Archive maintenance
- need a daily/weekly job that grabs robots.txt and updates the archive to remove content from it
