- Charsets
    - Not using them when parsing/indexing content
    - Incorrectly outputing all content as UTF-8 in archive view

- Archive view
    - Setting a top header on all text content, but header has Gemtext markup
        - Prehaps wrap text in preformatted gates?
    - Not rewriting hyperlinks in Archive View
    - Better handling of non-text content
        - always show a text landing page
        - Include text about when it was captured
        - have link to the file
        - have link to other verions



- Delorean

	- Show number of captures in match view?
	- Increase number of match views
	- Maybe should a filetype icon?
		probably makes sense to do this for the PAge Info page aas well.


Diff/stuff in archive is odd:

gemini://localhost/archive/history?gemini%3a%2f%2fnicksphere.ch%2f2021%2f01%2f31%2fsite-update-008%2f

//crawler
- Support 44 slow down




// WARC refactor:
- Need to make sure detected language is normalized to ISO lang codes
- When converting older crawls to WARC, not properly seeing truncated header in output WARCs
- 44 slow downs probably shouldn't be imported into the search DB or archive

- WarcProtocol parser is pretty slow. 2x slower than warcio on my laptop, and about 100x slower than a raw read baseline

- File extension needs to be added to Documents data to better support future "ext:" search operator
- File type detection needs to be added to support future "type:png" search operator

Archive maintenance
- need a daily/weekly job that grabs robots.txt and updates the archive to remove content from it
